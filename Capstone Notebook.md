<h2>Neighborhoods of New Orleans Analysis - Capstone Project for Applied Data Science Specialization<h2/>
 <h3>Introduction and problem description<h3/>

<h4>For this project, I would like to group neighborhoods of New Orleans, LA, based on accessibility to a variety of venues in those neighborhoods, and then assess some characteristics of each group and recommend which ones would be most suitable to live in for family with teenage kids. Characteristics of the neighborhoods I would like to pursue are for example access to schools, doctor's offices, swimming pools, parks, shops, etc.<h4/>

<h4>Data description <h4/>
I will use the data obtained from Wikipedia, containing a list of New Orleans neighborhoods, with coordinates for each. There are 72 neighborhoods listed on the Wiki page. From Foursquare API I will get a list of most common types of venues in each neighborhood and then will apply the k-means algorithm to cluster neighborhoods. For each cluster I will try to assess some characteristics of each neighborhood, especially will be looking for places with easy access to schools, doctor's offices, parks. Based on the k-means results I will try to recommend which areas would be the most suitable for a family with kids to move in. Probably in my recommendations, I would avoid crowded tourist areas and loud partying areas.
